<h2>Login Page</h2>

I designed responsive log in page by following @AsmrProg tutorial as a process of learning coding. In this assignment, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The design follows minimalist style by a soft and light look. The elements are low contrast as the background, and it's only distinguished by shadows and highlights surrounding the element.

This design have login and register switch animation.
